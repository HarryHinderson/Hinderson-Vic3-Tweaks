# Hinderson-Vic3-Tweaks
A Victoria 3 mod changing/adding a bunch of small things

This is just a small mod I developed to change some things I think are dumb. 

## COMPATIBILITY:
*Should* be compatible with most things that don't change the history files all too much, or the default flags/dynamic names.

## CHANGES:

- Cape (CAP) and South Africa (SAF) made separate tags
- Somalia, Franconia, Tyrol, Silesia, Styria, Brandenburg tags added
- Changed logic for Austria/Prussia formable/releasables
- Made West Prussia default capital for Prussia. Made decision to move the capital back to Berlin if its ever lost.
- NGF and SGF made releasable
- Ghana and Gold Coast dynamic names for Ashanti
- Made way for Natalia to appear. Unfortunately still ahistorical as South Africa is probably the least accurate part of the game and would need considerable changes to make it more accurate, but it crops up from time to time.
- Slightly buffed Egypt and nerfed Ottomans
- Gave Egypt 50 infamy at the start
- Temporarily made it so Britain can use the colonial administration decision if they have a dude in South Africa. A bit of a quick fix, a more temporary solution
- Changed Oranje and Transivaal starting army law to national militia
- Gave Ashanti landed voting and agrarianism at the start of the game
- Gave Greece and Serbia claims on their homelands
- Made the requirements for becoming a banana republic a bit more strict
- Added Hashemite Arabia dynamic name for if it controls Nejd
- Added Alawiyya Empire dynamic name for if Egypt controls East Thrace 

### HIGH PRIORITY:
- Fix up the flags of the new countries
- Add Gold Coast dynamic flag
- Fix new dynamic color

### LOW PRIORITY:
- Add popups to new events?
- Fix up boer flavor
- Fix up South Africa unification, add canada/australia-esque flavor for it
	- Great Britain/South Africa can unite south africa if they/their overlord has the territory (either directly or through puppets) required to do so. South Africa unification event makes them a dominion if they're under an overlord?

### LONG TERM:
- Primary culture rework (!!!!!!) (Maybe this should just be a separate mod)
- Decision to move the Turkish capital to Ankara
- Flag logic fixing
- New Formables: Banat, Dalmatia, slavonia, Greater Poland/Posen
- More africa formables/releasables (Lesotho, Botswana, and Togo)
- Subject flags for South African minors
- Indian independence journal (wait until after DLC)
- Italian reconquest journal
- Further rebalance Egypt/Ottoman start, add custom wargoals for Egypt? Without player intervention, they should be the ones seeking blood in the water, only to be thwarted by Europeans coming to the aid of the Ottomans
- Made landed voting no longer locked behind tech (It isn't actually that new! Powerful parliaments of nobility and other notable estates have existed for a LONG time! England just wrapped it around the structure of a modern state!!! (Also, Landed Voting isn't even that good!!!))
	- New landed voting political party names? Conservative Party = "Court Faction", Liberal Party = "Country Faction", Agrarian Party = "Popular Faction", etc
